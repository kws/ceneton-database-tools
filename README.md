# Ceneton Indexer

This repository provides a more accessible mirror of the **Ceneton** database, published and maintained by
Leiden University at [let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton](https://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton/).

Ceneton (Corpus of Middle Dutch Theatre Texts Online), edited by A.J.E. Harmsen, offers digitized editions
of early Dutch theatrical works. While the official site distributes the data via *FileMaker Pro*, a commercial
and proprietary platform, this mirror aims to make the material more usable for researchers, developers,
and educators by providing the data in open formats. **Please note:** the database content is the intellectual
property of Leiden University and A.J.E. Harmsen; this repository makes no claim of ownership over the data.
